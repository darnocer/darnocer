## Complete Documentation 
I believe that complete, but simple and easy-to-understand documentation should also be readily available and easy to find. I also think more things need to be written in bullet points!! I often find myself compiling the essentials for my own understanding, and I want to share some of the highlights with the world in hopes of helping just one other person! :earth_americas:
